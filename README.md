# csvtojson
In this program I implemented a converter from CSV format to JSON format. 
The program reads the contents of a CSV file, parses it and converts it into a JSON data structure. 
This is a program that will read a CSV file, parse it into individual columns and create a dictionary for each entry in JSON format,
where the keys are the column names and the values are the corresponding values in that row.
